# Tensorflow 

This is a GPU benchmarking using tensorflow code derived from this [link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/11/benchmarking-cpu-and-gpu-performance-with-tensorflow/).

**Files:**
1. **bench_tensorflow.py** : The python script to run. 
2. **a100_submit_tensorflow.sh** : The job submission script to A100 GPU cards.
3. **v100_submit_tensorflow.sh** : The job submission script to V100 GPU cards.
4. **submit_tensorflow.sh** : The job submission script to any GPU cards either A100 or V100.
5. **tensorflow_install.sh** : Helping script to replicate the conda environment used for testing.
